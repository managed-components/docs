# Managed Component

Tools that provide a Managed Component can profit from multiple capabilities:

- **Same domain**: Serve assets from the same domain as the website itself, for faster and more secure execution
- **Website-wide events system**: Hook to a pre-existing events system that the website uses for tracking events - no need to define tool specific API
- **Server logic**: Provide server-side logic on the same domain as the website, including proxying a different server, serving static assets or generating dynamic responses, reducing the load on the tool's servers
- **Server-side rendered widgets and embeds**: Easily extend the capabilities of the website with widgets and embeds that are performant and secure
- **Reliable client events**: Subscribe to client-side events in a cross-platform reliable way
- **Pre-Page-Rendering Actions**: Run server-side actions that read or write a website page, before the browser started rendering it
- **Integrated Consent Manager support**: Easier integration in a consent-aware environment
